      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The FDA has now confirmed radioactive cesium-137 contamination in
        imported foods — first in Indonesian shrimp, now in cloves. Even when
        blocked at the border, these events expose how fragile and unprotected
        the global food supply chain is. One mistake, one missed shipment, and
        contaminated food reaches families.
      </p>

      <h2>Reality</h2>
      <p>
        Radioactive isotopes like cesium-137 mimic nutrients such as potassium,
        lodging themselves deep inside muscle, bone, and organ tissue. Once
        inside the body, they emit gamma radiation 24/7, raising cancer and
        organ-damage risks. There is no government system that can guarantee
        100% interception of tainted imports.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution — Radiamel®</h2>
      <p>
        Radiamel® is the first defense-grade formula engineered to bind,
        neutralize, and escort radioactive isotopes like cesium-137 safely out
        of the body.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Binds isotopes before they integrate into tissues.</li>
        <li>
          Converts risk into harmless waste that the body excretes naturally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides peace of mind in a world where contamination events are not
          hypothetical — they’re happening right now.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Now</h2>
      <p>
        The shrimp and spice recalls are not isolated accidents; they’re
        signals. Globalization has tied our food supply to unstable regions and
        poor oversight. Radiamel® exists to close the gap between FDA recalls
        and true personal safety.
